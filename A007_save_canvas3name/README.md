## Save Canvas Contents to Local System with File name

In previous example, A006, we implement an feature saving a canvas image by a button.
However, after clicking button, the download is readily performed with predifined directory and file name. 
This is inconvenient when we want to specify the directory and file name of the image.
In this example, Let's change the automatic download into a manual one.


## Code and Results
