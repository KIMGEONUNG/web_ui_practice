## Transfer Image Data

In previous example, we transfered text string.
In this example, we try to transfer image data.
The scenario is simple. 
First, the client sends a color image to python backend.
Then, the backend gets the image data and converts into grayscale image.
Finally, the grayscale is returned to the client and is visualized in the web page.
