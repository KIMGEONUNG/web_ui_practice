## HTML and Javascript Examples 

This project aims to practice and documentate HTML and Javascript examples and
develop my web UI skills.
Finally, I would like to construct a demo program for my research in some future.

### Example List

The ID format consists of two parts like \{prefix\}\{number\}. 
The prefix _A_ means a implementation for frontend-only feature.
The prefix _B_ means a implementation for backend-related feature including client-server communications.
The prefix _P_ means a small project.
The prefix _Z_ means a low-priority future work.
